Tileskymap.py reads in single/multiple skymaps and attempts to provide 
the best tiling layout using a 'greedy tile' strategy. The version
here is designed for use during the early stages of Advanced LIGO/VIRGO
using the GOTO prototype observatory. 

The user can choose a range of options, such as tiling with galaxy 
weighting, or selecting between the two GOTO configurations (4- and
8-astrograph designs).

Output is in the form of a list of tiles, ordered by probability,
as well as optional plots (geocentric, or celestial).

Pre-requisites:
===============

A list of modules required for the script to work can be found 
under the tools directory. Easy installation can be completed
using

    $ pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
    
However, if certain modules already exists, you should
be able to easily install modules required.


Running skymaptile.py
======================

The basic method for calling the script with default settings is:

	$ python tileskymap.py <skymap-file>

A list of user-changeable options can be found using:

    $ python tileskymap.py -h

Output:-

usage: tileskymap.py [-h] [-i ID] [-p PATH] [-t MAXT] [-f MAXF] [-s SCOPES]
                     [-g] [-n] [--geoplot] [--plot] [--makegrid]
                     [--tiles TILES]
                     [infiles [infiles ...]]

This script creates pointings for selected telescopes, with given skymap
files.

positional arguments:
  infiles               Space separated input files (default: None)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i ID, --id ID        Name of output files (without extension) (default: )
  -p PATH, --path PATH  Output path (default: ./)
  -t MAXT, --maxt MAXT  Number of tiles to return (default: 100)
  -f MAXF, --maxf MAXF  Maximum fraction of visible skymap to tile (default:
                        0.95)
  -s SCOPES, --scopes SCOPES
                        Number of telescopes for GOTO configuration, 4 or 8
                        (default: 4)
  -g, --usegals         Use GWGC in tiling/plotting (default: False)
  -n, --nightsky        Use nightsky visbility in tiling/plotting (default:
                        False)
  --geoplot             Plot in geographic coordinates, (lat, lon) (default:
                        False)
  --plot                Plot in RA-Dec (default: False)
  --makegrid            Create fixed grid of tiles on sky. WARNING: Can take
                        some time. (default: False)
  --tiles TILES         Location of pre-made fixed grid of tiles on sky.
                        (default: ./tiles/)
    

Notes
=====

    Currently the script assumes greedy tiling is required. However, this may
    be sub-optimal given the large filed-of-view of GOTO, and poor pointing
    from the GW detectors, particularly in the 2-detector scenario, and is
    an avenue of future work.
